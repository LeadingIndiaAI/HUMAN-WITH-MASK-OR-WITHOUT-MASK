# human-with-mask-or-without-mask
The project We worked on was 'Human with a mask or Without mask?' using Deep Learning Techniques. we have successfully built a CNN model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not. This can be used in numerous applications. Sporting a mask may be necessary for the near future, considering the COVID-19 crisis, and this method to detect if the person wears a face mask may come in handy.

# Results
The model was evaluated with the help of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and Table 2 represents these evaluation parameters. The graphical representation of training and testing accuracy is shown in Fig 2. It can be observed from Fig 2 that CNN achieved accuracy between 91-92%. For better understanding, a confusion matrix was created in Fig 1. At the end, we found the accuracy. 

# Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a CNN based face mask detection system to differentiate people with facemask and people without a face mask. From this experiment, it is concluded that the proposed approach for detecting if the person is wearing a mask or not using the Deep Learning techniques can be efficiently used to develop the face recognition systems.
